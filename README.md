# The-Network

This application is a social media platform where users can interact with each other. Users can create profiles, make posts, and add other users as friends. Each post, or "thought", can be commented on, creating a space for discussion. Users can edit or delete their posts, and manage their list of friends as they wish. All activities are timestamped, and these timestamps are neatly formatted for easy reading.
